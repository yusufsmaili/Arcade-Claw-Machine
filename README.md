# 🕹️ Arcade Claw Machine (Prototype)

This project is a mini-sized arcade claw machine designed and built as part of a final project for **EMT 2461 (Electromechanical Software)**. The machine is fully student-built and coded, using Arduino hardware and custom mechanical design.

> 🚧 **Note:** This repository is still in progress. Additional files including finalized code, wiring diagrams, and media will be uploaded soon.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a functional arcade claw machine from scratch using **Arduino**, **C++**, and various mechanical/electrical components. The joystick allows users to control a claw along X, Y, and Z axes to retrieve small items.

## 🔩 Hardware Used

- **Arduino Mega (Elegoo)**
- 3x DC Motors (for X, Y, Z movement)
- 1x Servo Motor (for claw open/close)
- L298N Motor Driver Modules
- Joystick Module
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Custom-built aluminum extrusion frame
